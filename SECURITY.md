# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version of SpeakDrop on the `main` branch and published through [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/randolphrj/speakdrop/releases). Older installers are not patched in place; upgrade to the newest release when a fix is available.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue in SpeakDrop — for example unsafe handling of the Gladia API key, clipboard contents, local config/history data, or the paste / Accessibility integration — please report it privately.

Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/randolphrj/speakdrop/security/advisories/new) for this repository, with a clear description, impact assessment, and steps to reproduce when possible.

Please do not open a public GitHub issue or pull request that discloses an unfixed vulnerability.

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days and to keep you informed while we investigate and ship a fix.

## Scope notes

- SpeakDrop stores the API key and settings locally in the user config directory; treat that machine as trusted.
- Official macOS releases are signed with Gladia's Developer ID certificate. Fork and local builds use ad-hoc signing and are not Gladia-signed.
- Transcription audio and results are processed by the Gladia Live Transcription API under Gladia’s [privacy notice](https://www.gladia.io/privacy-notice) and [terms & conditions](https://www.gladia.io/terms-conditions). See [Privacy and data handling](README.md#privacy-and-data-handling) in the README for what leaves the device vs. what stays local. Report Gladia platform issues through Gladia’s support channels, not this repository, unless they are specific to this client’s usage.
